Traditional NN, Recurrent NN both for Classification and Regression, using Keras functional API to create the most complex structures, including:
1. Categorical Embedding to reduce dimensions of categorical variables
2. Multitask Learning, consisting of a double loss function to minimize as a common loss, producing two outputs
